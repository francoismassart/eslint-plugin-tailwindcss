Rules enforcing best practices and consistency using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) v2.1.2

> **üéâ Since v1.5.0, the plugin will parse the `tailwind.config.js` file and use the correct values based on your own settings.**
>
> üëç Most of [the new JIT mode features](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode#new-features) are also supported.

## Supported Rules

Learn more about each supported rules by reading their documentation:

- [`classnames-order`](docs/rules/classnames-order.md): order classnames by target properties then by variants (`[size:][theme:][state:]`)
- [`no-custom-classname`](docs/rules/no-custom-classname.md): only allow classnames from Tailwind CSS and the values from the `whitelist` option
- [`no-contradicting-classname`](docs/rules/no-contradicting-classname.md): e.g. avoid `p-2 p-3`, different Tailwind CSS classnames (`pt-2` & `pt-3`) but targeting the same property several times for the same variant.

Using ESLint extension for Visual Studio Code, you will get these messages

You can can the same information on your favorite command line software as well.

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org):

```
$ npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss`:

```
$ npm i eslint-plugin-tailwindcss --save-dev
```

Add `tailwindcss` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["tailwindcss"]
}
```

## Configuration

Use our preset to get reasonable defaults:

```
  "extends": [
    "plugin:tailwindcss/recommended"
  ]
```

If you do not use a preset you will need to specify individual rules and add extra configuration:

Configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

> The following lines are matching the configuration saved in the `recommended` preset...

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "tailwindcss/classnames-order": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/no-custom-classname": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/no-contradicting-classname": "error"
  }
}
```

Learn more about [Configuring Rules in ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/rules).

## Optional shared settings

Most rules shares the same settings, instead of duplicating some options...

You should also specify settings that will be shared across all the plugin rules.
[More about eslint shared settings](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#adding-shared-settings).

All these settings have nice default values that are explained in each rules' documentation. I'm listing them in the code below just to show them.

```json5
{
  "settings": {
    "tailwindcss": {
      // These are the default values but feel free to customize
      "callees": ["classnames", "clsx", "ctl"],
      "config": "tailwind.config.js",
      "cssFiles": ["**/*.css", "!**/node_modules", "!**/.*", "!**/dist", "!**/build"],
      "groupByResponsive": false,
      "groups": defaultGroups, // imported from groups.js
      "prependCustom": false,
      "removeDuplicates": true,
      "whitelist": []
    }
  }
}
```

The plugin will look for each setting value in this order and stop looking as soon as it finds the settings:

1. In the rule option argument (rule level)
2. In the shared settings (plugin level)
3. Default value of the requested setting (plugin level)...

## Upcoming Rules

- `no-redundant-variant`: e.g. avoid `mx-5 sm:mx-5`, no need to redefine `mx` in `sm:` variant as it uses the same value (`5`)

- `only-valid-arbitrary-values`:
  - e.g. avoid `top-[42]`, only `0` value can be unitless.
  - e.g. avoid `text-[rgba(10%,20%,30,50%)]`, can't mix `%` and `0-255`.

## Alternatives

I wrote this plugin after searching for existing tools which perform the same task but didn't satisfied my needs:

- [eslint-plugin-tailwind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-tailwind), not bad but no support (yet) for variants sorting
- [Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind), only works within Visual Studio Code
