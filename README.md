Rules enforcing best practices and consistency using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## **üéâ Version 3 is now ready for TailwindCSS v3 üéâ**

## Make sure to use the correct version

- Still using TailwindCSS v2 ?
  - You should stick with `v1.x.x` or `v2.x.x` of this plugin (next support releases will be using major version `2`)
- Using TailwindCSS v3 ?
  - Make sure to use `v3.x.x` of this plugin

**If you are using the eslint extension, make sure to restart VSCode in order to use the lastest version of the plugin and not the former version from the cache.**

## Supported Rules

Learn more about each supported rules by reading their documentation:

- [`classnames-order`](docs/rules/classnames-order.md): order classnames by target properties then by variants (`[size:][theme:][state:]`)
- [`enforces-shorthand`](docs/rules/enforces-shorthand.md): merge multiple classnames into shorthand if possible e.g. `mx-5 my-5` should become `m-5`
- [`migration-from-tailwind-2`](docs/rules/migration-from-tailwind-2.md) for easy upgrade from TailwindCSS `v2` to `v3`.
  Warning: at the moment you should [temporary turn off the `no-custom-classname`](https://github.com/francoismassart/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/88) rule if you want to see the warning from `migration-from-tailwind-2`
- [`no-custom-classname`](docs/rules/no-custom-classname.md): only allow classnames from Tailwind CSS and the values from the `whitelist` option
- [`no-contradicting-classname`](docs/rules/no-contradicting-classname.md): e.g. avoid `p-2 p-3`, different Tailwind CSS classnames (`pt-2` & `pt-3`) but targeting the same property several times for the same variant.

Using ESLint extension for Visual Studio Code, you will get these messages
![detected-errors](.github/output.png)

You can can the same information on your favorite command line software as well.

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org):

```
$ npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss`:

```
$ npm i eslint-plugin-tailwindcss --save-dev
```

Add `tailwindcss` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["tailwindcss"]
}
```

## Configuration

Use our preset to get reasonable defaults:

```
  "extends": [
    "plugin:tailwindcss/recommended"
  ]
```

If you do not use a preset you will need to specify individual rules and add extra configuration:

Configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

> The following lines are matching the configuration saved in the `recommended` preset...

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "tailwindcss/classnames-order": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/enforces-shorthand": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/migration-from-tailwind-2": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/no-custom-classname": "warn",
    "tailwindcss/no-contradicting-classname": "error"
  }
}
```

Learn more about [Configuring Rules in ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/rules).

## Optional shared settings

Most rules shares the same settings, instead of duplicating some options...

You should also specify settings that will be shared across all the plugin rules.
[More about eslint shared settings](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#adding-shared-settings).

All these settings have nice default values that are explained in each rules' documentation. I'm listing them in the code below just to show them.

```json5
{
  "settings": {
    "tailwindcss": {
      // These are the default values but feel free to customize
      "callees": ["classnames", "clsx", "ctl"],
      "config": "tailwind.config.js",
      "cssFiles": ["**/*.css", "!**/node_modules"],
      "groupByResponsive": false,
      "groups": defaultGroups, // imported from groups.js
      "prependCustom": false,
      "removeDuplicates": true,
      "whitelist": []
    }
  }
}
```

The plugin will look for each setting value in this order and stop looking as soon as it finds the settings:

1. In the rule option argument (rule level)
2. In the shared settings (plugin level)
3. Default value of the requested setting (plugin level)...

## Upcoming Rules

- `validate-modifiers`: I don't know if possible, but I'd like to make sure all the modifiers prefixes of a classname are valid e.g. `yolo:bg-red` should throw an error...

- `no-redundant-variant`: e.g. avoid `mx-5 sm:mx-5`, no need to redefine `mx` in `sm:` variant as it uses the same value (`5`)

- `only-valid-arbitrary-values`:
  - e.g. avoid `top-[42]`, only `0` value can be unitless.
  - e.g. avoid `text-[rgba(10%,20%,30,50%)]`, can't mix `%` and `0-255`.

## Alternatives

I wrote this plugin after searching for existing tools which perform the same task but didn't satisfied my needs:

- [eslint-plugin-tailwind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-tailwind), not bad but no support (yet) for variants sorting
- [Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind), only works within Visual Studio Code
