/**
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a worker script which is ran in node's `worker_threads`.
 * ü§ì This means that it is not executed in the main thread, but in a separate thread.
 * üòÖ Because of this, expect some disturbances, like:
 *   - `console.log` won't work `vitest`... (seems to work with `jest`).
 *   - You cannot pass complex objects as arguments, only serializable ones.
 *   - You cannot retun complex objects, only serializable ones.
 *   - e.g. You cannot return the `utils.context` directly, but you can return some of its properties...
 *
 * ‚ÑπÔ∏è It uses the `*.mjs` extension to indicate that it is an ES module.
 * ‚úÖ We still check the syntax with TypeScript, but it is not a TypeScript file.
