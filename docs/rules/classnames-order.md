# Use a consistent orders for the Tailwind CSS classnames, based on property then on variants (tailwindcss/classnames-order)

Enforces a consistent order of the Tailwind CSS classnames and its variants.

> **Note**: By default, it uses the same order as the official [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container) **v2.1.1**

## Rule Details

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```html
<div class="sm:w-6 custom relative w-12"></div>
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```html
<div class="relative w-12 sm:w-6 custom"></div>
```

### Options

```js
...
"tailwindcss/classnames-order": [<enabled>, {
  "callees": Array<string>,
  "config": <string>|<object>,
  "groupByResponsive": <boolean>,
  "groups": Array<object>,
  "officialSorting": <boolean>,
  "prependCustom": <boolean>,
  "removeDuplicates": <boolean>,
  "tags": Array<string>,
}]
...
```

### `callees` (default: `["classnames", "clsx", "ctl"]`)

If you use some utility library like [@netlify/classnames-template-literals](https://github.com/netlify/classnames-template-literals), you can add its name to the list to make sure it gets parsed by this rule.

For best results, gather the declarative classnames together, avoid mixing conditional classnames in between, move them at the end.

### `config` (default: `"tailwind.config.js"`)

By default the plugin will try to load the file `tailwind.config.js` at the root of your project.

This allows the plugin to use your customized `colors`, `spacing`, `screens`...

You can provide another path or filename for your Tailwind CSS config file like `"config/tailwind.js"`.

If the external file cannot be loaded (e.g. incorrect path or deleted file), an empty object `{}` will be used instead.

It is also possible to directly inject a configuration as plain `object` like `{ prefix: "tw-", theme: { ... } }`.

Finally, the plugin will [merge the provided configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#referencing-in-java-script) with [Tailwind CSS's default configuration](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/master/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js).

### `groupByResponsive` (default: `true`)

When this option was introduced in version 2.x.x of the plugin, this setting was set to `false` to avoid a tsunami of reorder in the classnames.
You had to set it to `true` intentionally.

Since version 3 of the plugin, the default value is now `true`, grouping by responsive modifier in priority vs. grouping by property.

Linting this code:

`<div class="rounded sm:rounded-lg lg:rounded-2xl p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8">...</div>`

By default, the ordering process will group the classnames by variants then by properties:

`<div class="p-4 rounded sm:p-6 sm:rounded-lg lg:p-8 lg:rounded-2xl">...</div>`

Set `groupByResponsive` to `false` and the ordering will work by properties, then by variants:

`<div class="p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8 rounded sm:rounded-lg lg:rounded-2xl">...</div>`

### `groups` (default defined in [groups.js](../../lib/config/groups.js))

If you really need to, you can write your own configuration.

`groups` is a fairly long configuration array which defines the hierarchical orders to apply to your classnames prior to variants sorting.

I would recommend you to duplicate the `groups.js` file, move it in your own config location and move items as you wish. At its deepest, it is a list of patterns that will be used inside a regular expression.

```js
// custom-groups.js
module.exports.groups = [
  {
    type: 'Layout',
    members: [
      {
        type: 'Floats',
        members: 'float\\-(right|left|none)',
      },
      {
        type: 'Box Sizing',
        members: 'box\\-(border|content)',
      },
      ...
    ],
  },
  ...
];
```

Import your own file then set it in your rules config.

```js
// .eslintrc.js
...
const customGroups = require('custom-groups').groups;
...
"tailwindcss/classnames-order": [2, {
  "groups": customGroups
}]
...
```

### `officialSorting` (default: `false`)

Set `officialSorting` to `true` if you want to use the same ordering rules as the official plugin `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`. Enabling this setting will cause `groupByResponsive`, `groups`, and `prependCustom` options to be ignored.

### `prependCustom` (default: `false`)

By default, classnames which doesn't belong to Tailwind CSS will be pushed at the end. Set `prependCustom` to `true` if you prefer to move them at the beginning.

### `removeDuplicates` (default: `true`)

Duplicate classnames are automatically removed but you can always disable this behavior by setting `removeDuplicates` to `false`.

### `tags` (default: `[]`)

Optional, if you are using tagged templates, you should provide the tags in this array.

## Further Reading

### How it works

1. Groups classnames by property
2. Sorts each group based on configuration
3. Within each group, it sorts the variants:
   1. Responsive (e.g. `sm:` ... `2xl:`, the order is based on the breakpoints defined in `theme.screens`)
   2. Theme
      1. (empty)
      2. `dark:`
   3. State (e.g. `hover:`... the order is based on `variantOrder`)

### Default groups

The [default `groups` configuration](../../lib/config/groups.js) will apply the following order, as in the official [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container).

Each line represents a group (based on property).
